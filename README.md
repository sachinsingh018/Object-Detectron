# Object Detectron

Welcome to this repository! 

Here, we have undertaken the task of building an application using streamlit library along with YOLOv3 to build an application to perform efficient object detection.

The YOLO (You only look once) based detector can detect upto 80 category of objects.

Our detector is also capable of performing detection of videos along with images. Feel free to go through the below mentioned instructions to run the application as well as look at the video for the same.

# Instructions

1. Clone the repository using the git clone command 

2. Next, we go ahead with installing all the libraries needed to be installed for the same which would be mentioned in the requirements.txt file for the same.

3. Now, download the yolov3.cfg file and yolov3.weights file and place it in the same directory as that of the project code. 

4. yolov3 weights can be downloaded from the link https://github.com/patrick013/Object-Detection---Yolov3/tree/master/model.

5. Now, run the application using the command streamlit run object-detectron.py.

!!!Enjoy. Feel free to drop a star for this repository. Thanks!!! ðŸ˜€
